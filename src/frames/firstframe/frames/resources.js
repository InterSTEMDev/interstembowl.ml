                  <summary>Quiz category</summary>
                  <p>The quiz portion of the competition will test studentsâ€™ ability to quickly and accurately solve problems in a variety of subjects: mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and computer science. All participants will choose three subjects to get tested on. The exam will be proctored live through Zoom (details will be sent out to all registrants through email). There will be three time slots from which the participant can choose to take the test.</p>
                  <p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Saturday, March 20th, 2021, 1:00 - 4:00pm PST</li>
                      <li>Saturday, March 27th, 2021, 1:00 - 4:00pm PST</li>
                      <li>Saturday, March 27th, 2021, 8:00 - 11:00pm PST </li>
                    </ol>
                  </p>
                  <p>During each timeslot, all participants will be provided with 3 separate exams, covering subjects of their choice. Each exam will be 45 minutes long in duration and contain 50 multiple choice questions of varying difficulty. All problems are weighted equally and must be submitted through Google Forms on time.</p>
                  <p>Participants will be allowed blank scratch paper (no lined or graph paper) and writing utensils. Calculators, protractors, compasses, and electronic devices are strictly forbidden. All participants must obtain access to a working microphone and webcam -- students will be expected to keep cameras on and microphones unmuted for the duration of the contest.</p>
                  <p>Everyone will be eligible to compete for awards in the competition. Each subject will have an individual award, delivered to the highest-scoring student(s). There will also be a separate team award, given to the team with the greatest sum of top scores for each subject. To account for variability in test difficulties, scores will be normalized on a bell curve when calculating team scores.</p>

                <b>How do teams work?</b>
                <p>On the binding registration form, you can specify a team of up to four people to compete with. Team members must complete the quiz individually, but they are welcome to submit a team article or video. To determine team prizes, the top score for each quiz subject on the team will be summed; the team with the highest aggregate score will receive first place.</p>
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Can I win prizes?</b> 
                <p>If you live in the United States, you are eligible to win any of our prizes! You can win multiple prizes in different categories (quiz, article, video, team), but not multiple prizes in the quiz category (e.g. physics and biology).</p>

                <b>Are the problem writers qualified?</b>
                <p>Many of our problem writers have done very well in olympiad contests. There are several USAMO qualifiers on our problem writing team, as well as students who have qualified for USABO / USNCO / USAPhO semifinals. </p>
