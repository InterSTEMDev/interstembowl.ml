              <p>
                The quiz portion of the competition will test studentsâ€™ ability
                to quickly and accurately solve problems in a variety of
                subjects: mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and computer
                science. All participants will choose three subjects to get
                tested on. The exam will be proctored live through Zoom (details
                will be sent out to all registrants through email). There will
                be three time slots from which the participant can choose to
                take the test.

              </p>
              <p>
                During each timeslot, all participants will be provided with 3
                separate exams, covering subjects of their choice. Each exam
                will be 45 minutes long in duration and contain 50 multiple
                choice questions of varying difficulty. All problems are
                weighted equally and must be submitted through Google Forms on
                time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Participants will be allowed blank scratch paper (no lined or
                graph paper) and writing utensils. Calculators, protractors,
                compasses, and electronic devices are strictly forbidden. All
                participants must obtain access to a working microphone and
                webcam -- students will be expected to keep cameras on and
                microphones unmuted for the duration of the contest.
              </p>
              <p>
                Everyone will be eligible to compete for awards in the
                competition. Each subject will have an individual award,
                delivered to the highest-scoring student(s). There will also be
                a separate team award, given to the team with the greatest sum
                of top scores for each subject. To account for variability in
                test difficulties, scores will be normalized on a bell curve
                when calculating team scores.

          <p>
            <b>What is InterSTEM? What does InterSTEM do?</b>
            <p>
              InterSTEM is a non-profit organization that hopes to raise
              awareness about the relevance of STEM-related topics to the world.
              Functioning mainly online, InterSTEM offers a tutoring service for
              students, updates readers about current news in STEM through
              articles and blog posts, and plans collaborative projects between
              high school and elementary students. Through the integration of
              science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, InterSTEM
              provides students of all backgrounds the opportunity to explore
              and dive deeper into the world of STEM. To learn more about
              InterSTEM, please join our{" "}
              <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Y9KSFVZ">Discord server</a>{" "}
              and visit our{" "}

            </p>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>How do teams work?</b>
            <p>
              On the binding registration form, you can specify a team of up to
              four people to compete with. Team members must complete the quiz
              individually, but they are welcome to submit a team article or
              video. To determine team prizes, the top score for each quiz
              subject on the team will be summed; the team with the highest
              aggregate score will receive first place.
            </p>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Can I win prizes?</b>
            <p>
              If you live in the United States, you are eligible to win any of
              our prizes! You can win multiple prizes in different categories
              (quiz, article, video, team), but not multiple prizes in the quiz
              category (e.g. physics and biology).
            </p>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Are the problem writers qualified?</b>
            <p>
              Many of our problem writers have done very well in olympiad
              contests. There are several USAMO qualifiers on our problem
              writing team, as well as students who have qualified for USABO /
              USNCO / USAPhO semifinals.{" "}
